Requirements
Python 3.8+
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.3
matplotlib==3.7.1
seaborn==0.12.2
scikit-learn==1.3.0
jupyter==1.0.0

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ayushman46/Sales-Predictor.git
cd Sales-Predictor

2. Create Virtual Environment
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv sales_env

# Activate it
# Windows:
sales_env\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source sales_env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Quick Start
python sales_prediction.py

With Your Own Data
predictor = SalesPredictionModel()
predictor.load_data('path/to/your/Advertising.csv')

Interactive Analysis
jupyter notebook
# Open sales_analysis.ipynb for step-by-step analysis

Dataset Structure
The project works with advertising datasets containing:
Column | Description | Type
TV | TV advertising spend ($) | Numeric
Radio | Radio advertising spend ($) | Numeric
Newspaper | Newspaper advertising spend ($) | Numeric
Sales | Product sales (target variable) | Numeric

Model Performance
The project automatically evaluates models using multiple metrics:

R² Score: Variance explained by the model
RMSE: Root Mean Square Error
MAE: Mean Absolute Error
Feature Importance: Which channels drive sales most

Sample Output
Best performing model: Random Forest (R² = 0.89)

Key Findings:
1. TV advertising shows the strongest correlation with sales (0.782)
2. Average sales: $14.02
3. Model can explain 89.1% of sales variance

Recommendations:
1. Focus more budget on TV advertising for maximum impact
2. Use the trained model to optimize advertising spend allocation

Making Predictions
```python
# Initialize the model
predictor = SalesPredictionModel()
predictor.load_data()
predictor.prepare_data()
predictor.train_models()

# Predict sales for new advertising spend
prediction = predictor.predict_sales(
    tv_spend=200,      # $200 TV advertising
    radio_spend=40,    # $40 Radio advertising  
    newspaper_spend=30 # $30 Newspaper advertising
)

print(f"Predicted Sales: ${prediction:,.2f}")
```

Visualization Examples
